# Tfl Service Line Status Project
This project focuses on the development of a React application that displays the status of each Tfl service line (except for Tfl Rail).

## Technologies
- ReactJS, including HTML/JSX and CSS.
- Jasmine (for testing).

## Blockers and Resolutions
- Undefined error when attempting to access .env variables; I went on this [Medium blog](https://medium.com/better-programming/using-environment-variables-in-reactjs-9ad9c5322408). From this blog, I found that I had to rerun my dev server to access the newly-created .env variables.
